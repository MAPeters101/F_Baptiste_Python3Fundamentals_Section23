Question 4
Using both methods of generating throws, build a dictionary that contains the
face values as keys, and the number of times they were selected in the
simulated throws.

For example, assuming you made 100 throws using one of these methods, your
dictionary might look like this:

{
    '9': 39,
    '10': 27,
    'J': 28,
    'Q': 34,
    'K': 36,
    'A': 36
}
Note that your values in the dictionary should add up to 200 is you made one
100 throws.

Write a function that is given the function to use to generate the throws, the
number of throws to simulate, and returns this dictionary.
