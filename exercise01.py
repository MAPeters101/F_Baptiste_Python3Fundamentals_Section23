Question 1
Generate the sample space of rolling two 6-sided dice, numbered '9', '10', 'J',
'Q', 'K', 'A'.

(The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes).

Your result should be a list containing tuples for the outcome of each die,
e.g.

[('9', '9'),
 ('9', '10'),
 ('9', 'J'),
 ('9', 'Q'),
 ('9', 'K'),
 ('9', 'A'),
 ('10', '9'),
 ('10', '10'),
 ('10', 'J'),
 ('10', 'Q'),
 ('10', 'K'),
 ('10', 'A'),
 etc
Make this a function that returns the sample space, called make_sample_space.
